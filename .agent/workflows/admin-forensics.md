# NGO Forensic Review Workflow (Human-in-the-Loop)

This workflow describes how an authorized NGO employee can review the technical forensic reports generated by the "Digital Dignity" platform.

### Prerequisites
- Access to the internal backend server (running on port 5021).
- Authorization to access the `/admin` frontend route.

### Steps

1. **Access the Queue**
   - Navigate to the Admin Portal at `http://localhost:3000/admin`.
   - The dashboard will load the **Forensic Signal Queue**, showing reports submitted by victims.

2. **Select for Oversight**
   - Click on any report in the left-hand column to load its technical breakdown.
   - Look for the **Confidence Meter** (calculated by the Gemini Vision forensics layer).

3. **Analyze Technical Markers**
   - Review the **AI Diagnostic Summary**. This contains raw technical findings like edge inconsistencies or lighting mismatches.

   - Verify the **Visual Artifacts & Metadata Flags**. These are the specific technical indicators hidden from the victim to prevent trauma.

4. **Professional Conclusion**
   - Use the **Verify & Proceed** button to confirm the findings and escalate the complaint draft for the victim.
   - If the AI findings are inconclusive or false positives, use the **Flag for Review** button.

### Privacy Guardrails
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Never share the raw technical summaries (Confidence Scores, Indicator lists) directly with the victim. Always use the empathy-driven "Sakhi" interface reports to communicate with them.
